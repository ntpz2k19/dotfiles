# My Archlabs dotfiles
This dotfiles I get from default Archlabs openbox, However I use Archlabs icons from archlabs pkgbuilds https://bitbucket.org/archlabslinux/pkgbuilds.git, and for theme I use Numix Black Grape theme. In this case I use dual monitor, to generate command for monitor I use arandr.
