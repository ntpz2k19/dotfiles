# My Archlabs dotfiles
This dotfiles I get from default Archlabs openbox, However I use Archlabs icons from archlabs [pkgbuilds](git clone https://bitbucket.org/archlabslinux/pkgbuilds.git) repo, and for theme I use Numix Black Grape theme. In this case I use dual monitor, to generate command for monitor I use arandr.
